# RATIO-ANALYSIS
Phase 1: Data Preparation & Cleaning (Python)
Task: Using the Python pandas library, perform the following data manipulation steps to 
prepare the dataset for visualization.
1. Data Cleaning: Load the initial dataset and check for missing or null values.
o Standardize column headers and remove any duplicate records.
2. Type Conversion: Import the cleaned data.
o Convert the Revenue column into an Integer type (ensure any currency 
symbols or commas are removed before conversion).
3. Create a new calculated column titled Total Workers by summing the values of 
Workers and Previous Workers.
4. File Export: Save the final processed dataframe as a new file named 
NewCompany2.csv.
Phase 2: Data Visualization (Power BI)
Task: Import the NewCompany2.csv file into Power BI and develop a single-page dashboard 
containing the following visual elements:
1. City-wise Revenue: Generate a chart showing the total revenue distribution across 
different cities.
2. Metro-wise Growth: Visualize growth trends based on Metropolitan areas.
3. Temporal Filter: Implement a Button Slicer using the Founded Year column to allow 
users to filter the entire dashboard by the company’s age.
4. Workforce Analysis: Create a visualization showing the Average number of workers
per Industry, utilizing the Total Workers column created in Phase 1.
Phase 3: Reporting
Task: Finalize the project by exporting the completed Power BI dashboard as a PDF file for 
stakeholder review.
